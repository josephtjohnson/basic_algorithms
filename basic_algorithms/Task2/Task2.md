Description: The algorithm takes in an input list, determines if there is a pivot and then performs 
a binary search on the input list to determine if a target value is present

Time complexity: The time complexity of binary search will be O(log(n)). The time complexity will not increase
depending on the size of the input so this will hold.

Space complexity: Space complexity for this algorithm will be O(1) as no new data structures will need to be completed
depending on the input size.
