Description: This algorithm performs a single traversal of a data set that is assumed to be
consisting of 0s, 1s, or 2s. The elements of the dataset will be stored in secondary
sub-arrays and combined in a sorted fashion.

Time complexity: Because every element of the data set will need to be passed one time,
the time complexity for this algorithm will be O(n)

Space complexity: The space complexity for this algorithm will be O(1) as the size of the
input will not determine if other data structures are created.
