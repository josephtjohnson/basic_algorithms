Description: This algorithm takes in a number and determines what the floored square root is.

Time complexity: This algorithm utilizes a while loop thus giving it a time complexity of O(n).

Space complexity: Space complexity for this algorithm will be O(1) as no new data structures
will need to be created depending upon the input.
