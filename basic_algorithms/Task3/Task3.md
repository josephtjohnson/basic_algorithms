Description: This algorithm takes in an unsorted or sorted array. Once the array is received the pivot is determined,
then the recursive quick_sort() method sorts the array descendingly. The elements of the array are then combined into
two numbers that are no more than 1 decimal place apart and when combined together form the max of the possible combinations.

Time complexity: This algorithm will be O(n) time complexity as the worst case scenario is that the algorithm must
cycle trhough each element of the array.

Space complexity: Our space complexity remains linear O(n). New data structures are not being created depending upon the size of the input.
